Assignment 3:
Why We Are Entitled With A Bonus:
 
-> We created a log file for each running task of algo-simulator pair, so the execution can be 
   detailed and traced verbosely: 
    - Logger provides statistics of cleaned points during the simulation and at the end of it.
    - Described algo decisions and movements across the running simulation.
    - And more

-> UML diagram
-> Automated tools for testing - input files generator that creates house layouts 

-> Appealing for bonus for the implementation of the algoritms:
    - We have an algorithm base class that the two algos polymorficate it, i.e
      implementation of algorithm section is using polymorphism. The two submitted algos are sharing code,
      almost everything is layed down in the base class. As one can observe - the two algos we use
      in the code for running simulations of houses have only 1 function they implement!
