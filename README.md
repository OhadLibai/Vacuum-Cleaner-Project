HOW to run the project:
- the project has 3 makfile, 2 for algorithms and 1 for the simuation.
- the main make file is linked to the others
- the makefile has 3 targate
**This is vacuum cleaner project, meant to serve as a simulation of its cleaning session.**

**The program gets as inputs houses layouts and simulate each house with each attached algorithm and provide the cleaning results.**

**The basis of the cleaning task is layed here and can be ported in the future to real functioning vacuum.**

*Written in C++20, we aimed at making this project as OOP as possible, creating classes and use fundamental high level design approaches.    
Modular and abstracted as it can be, our code is not flat but rather abundant and consists of logic units  
that handle the many aspect of the project.  
As mentioned, we break it into its small many pieces, trying to create an overall readable,  
maintainable, self-contained and far more important a scalable project.*

*The running algorithms behind the scenes usues two variants of BFS scanning routine.*
